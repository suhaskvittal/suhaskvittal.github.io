    abstract = {Quantum measurement is important to quantum computing as it extracts out the outcome of the circuit at the end of the computation. Previously, all measurements have to be done at the end of the circuit. Otherwise, it will incur significant errors. But it is not the case now. Recently IBM starts supporting dynamic circuit through hardware (instead of software by simulator). With mid-circuit hardware measurement, we can improve circuit efficacy and fidelity from three aspects: (a) reduced qubit usage, (b) reduced swap insertion, and (c) improved fidelity. We demonstrate this using real-world applications Bernstein Verizani on real hardware and show that circuit resource usage can be improved by 60\%, and circuit fidelity can be improved by 15\%. We design a compiler-assisted tool that can find and exploit the tradeoff between qubit reuse, fidelity, gate count, and circuit duration. We also developed a method for identifying whether qubit reuse will be beneficial for a given application. We evaluated our method on a representative set of important applications. We can reduce resource usage by up to 80\% and improve circuit fidelity by up to 20\%.},

    abstract = {Quantum devices suffer from high error rates, which makes them ineffective for running practical applications. Quantum computers can be made fault tolerant using Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which protects quantum information by encoding logical qubits using data qubits and parity qubits. The data qubits collectively store the quantum information and the parity qubits are measured periodically to produce a syndrome, which is decoded by a classical decoder to identify the location and type of errors. To prevent errors from accumulating and causing a logical error, decoders must accurately identify errors in real-time, necessitating the use of hardware solutions because software decoders are slow. Ideally, a real-time decoder must match the performance of the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder. However, due to the complexity of the underlying Blossom algorithm, state-of-the-art real-time decoders either use lookup tables, which are not scalable, or use approximate decoding, which significantly increases logical error rates.In this paper, we leverage two key insights to enable practical real-time MWPM decoding. First, for near-term implementations (with redundancies up to distance d = 7) of surface codes, the Hamming weight of the syndromes tends to be quite small (less than or equal to 10). For this regime, we propose Astrea, which simply performs a brute-force search for the few hundred possible options to perform accurate decoding within a few nanoseconds (1ns average, 456ns worst-case), thus representing the first decoder to be able to do MWPM in real-time up-to distance 7. Second, even for codes that produce syndromes with higher Hamming weights (e.g. d = 9) the search for optimal pairings can be made more efficient by simply discarding the weights that denote significantly lower probability than the logical error-rate of the code. For this regime, we propose a greedy design called Astrea-G, which filters high-cost weights and reorders the search from high-likelihood pairings to low-likelihood pairings to produce the most likely decoding within 1μs (average 450ns). Our evaluations show that Astrea-G provides similar logical error-rates as the software-based MWPM for up-to d = 9 codes while meeting the real-time decoding latency constraints.},

    abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) codes can tolerate hardware
        errors by encoding fault-tolerant logical qubits using redundant
            physical qubits and detecting errors using parity checks. Leakage
            errors occur in quantum systems when a qubit leaves its
            computational basis and enters higher energy states. These errors
            severely limit the performance of QEC due to two reasons. First,
        they lead to erroneous parity checks that obfuscate the accurate
            detection of errors. Second, the leakage spreads to other qubits and
            creates a pathway for more errors over time. Prior works tolerate
            leakage errors by using leakage reduction circuits (LRCs) that
            modify the parity check circuitry of QEC codes. Unfortunately,
        naively using LRCs always throughout a program is sub-optimal because
            LRCs incur additional two-qubit operations that (1) facilitate
            leakage transport, and (2) as new sources of errors.
            Ideally, LRCs should only be used if leakage occurs, so that errors
            from both leakage as well as additional LRC operations are
            simultaneously minimized. However, identifying leakage errors in
            real-time is challenging. To enable the robust and efficient usage
            of LRCs, we propose ERASER that speculates the subset of qubits that
            may have leaked and only uses LRCs for those qubits. Our studies
            show that the majority of leakage errors typically impact the parity
            checks. We leverage this insight to identify the leaked qubits by
            analyzing the patterns in the failed parity checks. We propose
            ERASER+M that enhances ERASER by detecting leakage more accurately
            using qubit measurement protocols that can classify qubits into |0⟩,
        |1⟩ and |L⟩ states. ERASER and ERASER+M improve the logical error rate
            by up to 4.3x and 23x respectively compared to always using LRC.},

    abstract = {Fault-tolerant quantum computing relies on Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which encodes logical qubits into data and parity qubits. Error decoding is the process of translating the measured parity bits into types and locations of errors. To prevent a backlog of errors, error decoding must be performed in real-time (i.e., within 1μs on superconducting machines). Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) is an accurate decoding algorithm for surface code, and recent research has demonstrated real-time implementations of MWPM (RT-MWPM) for a distance of up to 9. Unfortunately, beyond d=9, the number of flipped parity bits in the syndrome, referred to as the Hamming weight of the syndrome, exceeds the capabilities of existing RT-MWPM decoders. In this work, our goal is to enable larger distance RT-MWPM decoders by using adaptive predecoding that converts high Hamming weight syndromes into low Hamming weight syndromes, which are accurately decoded by the RT-MWPM decoder.An effective predecoder must balance both accuracy (as any erroneous decoding by the predecoder contributes to the overall Logical Error Rate, termed as LER) and coverage (as the predecoder must ensure that the hamming weight of the syndrome is within the capability of the final decoder). In this paper, we propose Promatch, a real-time adaptive predecoder that predecodes both simple and complex patterns using a locality-aware, greedy approach. Our approach ensures two crucial factors: 1) high accuracy in prematching flipped bits, ensuring that the decoding accuracy is not hampered by the predecoder, and 2) enough coverage adjusted based on the main decoder's capability given the time constraints. Promatch represents the first real-time decoding framework capable of decoding surface codes of distances 11 and 13, achieving an LER of 2.6 \texttimes{} 10-14 for distance 13. Moreover, we demonstrate that running Promatch concurrently with the recently proposed Astrea-G achieves LER equivalent to MWPM LER, 3.4 \texttimes{} 10-15, for distance 13, representing the first real-time accurate decoder for up-to a distance of 13.},
