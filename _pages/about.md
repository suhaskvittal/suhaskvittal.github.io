Hi, I'm Suhas, a 2nd year PhD student at Georgia Tech advised by [Moin
Qureshi](https://moin.cc.gatech.edu). My research aims to reduce the overheads
of fault-tolerant quantum computation, which is projected to require tens of
millions of qubits. If we could reduce these overheads by 10x (or more!), then
useful quantum advantage could be achieved within the next 10 years, as opposed
when I start getting gray hairs.

My research has been published in top-tier computer architecture conferences
(ISCA, MICRO, HPCA, ASPLOS). Below is a truncated list of my lead-author papers.
